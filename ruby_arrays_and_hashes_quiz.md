# Homework

### A. Given the following data structure:

```
lines = ['Gyle Centre', 'Edinburgh Park', 'Murrayfield Stadium', 'Haymarket', 'Princes Street']
```

1. Work out how many stops there are in the current west array

lines.length


2. Return 'Edinburgh Park' from the array

lines[1]


3. How many ways can we return 'Princes Street' from the array?

#unsure on this one. Can think of both using its index, simply printing the entire list and writing a search for the name but not sure if that's what is being asked. Also using .pop


4. Work out the index position of 'Haymarket' 

lines.index("Haymarket")


5. Add 'Airport' to the start of the array 

lines.unshift("Airport")


6. Add 'York Place' to the end of the array

lines.shift("York Place")


7. Remove 'Edinburgh Park' from the array using it's name 

lines.delete("Edinburgh Park")


8. Delete 'Edinburgh Park' from the array by index

lines.delete_at(1)


9. Reverse the positions of the stops in the array

lines.reverse


10. Print out all of the stops using a for loop and a while loop

for stops in lines
  puts stops
end



### B. Given the following data structure:

```
  my_hash = {0 => "Zero", 1 => "One", :two => "Two", "two" => 2}
```

1. How would you return the string `"One"`?

my_hash[1]


2. How would you return the string `"Two"`?

my_hash[:two]


3. How would you return the number `2`?

my_hash["two"]


4. How would you add `{3 => "Three"}` to the hash? 

my_hash[3] = "Three"


5. How would you add `{:four => 4}` to the hash?

my_hash[:four] = 4




### C. Given the following data structure:

```
  users = {
    "Jonathan" => {
      :twitter => "jonnyt",
      :favourite_numbers => [12, 42, 75, 12, 5],
      :home_town => "Stirling",
      :pets => {
        "fluffy" => :cat,
        "fido" => :dog,
        "spike" => :dog
      }
    },
    "Erik" => {
      :twitter => "eriksf",
      :favourite_numbers => [8, 12, 24],
      :home_town => "Linithgow",
      :pets => {
        "nemo" => :fish,
        "kevin" => :fish,
        "spike" => :dog,
        "rupert" => :parrot
      }
    },
    "Avril" => {
      :twitter => "bridgpally",
      :favourite_numbers => [12, 14, 85, 88],
      :home_town => "Dunbar",
      :pets => {
        "colin" => :snake
      }
    },
  }
```

1. Return Jonathan's Twitter handle (i.e. the string `"jonnyt"`)

users["Jonathan"][:twitter]


2. Return Erik's hometown 

users["Erik"][:home_town]


3. Return the array of Erik's favorite numbers

users["Erik"][:favourite_numbers]


4. Return the type of Avril's pet Colin

users["Avril"][:pets]["colin"]


5. Return the smallest of Erik's favorite numbers

numbers = users["Erik"][:favourite_numbers]
numbers.sort!
puts numbers[0]


6. Return an array of Avril's favorite numbers that are even

#could not figure this one out. I created a variable that contained the array but could not find a way to separate only the even numbers. I tried a couple loops plus an .each do as well as trying to .split it. :(


7. Return an array of Jonathans favourite numbers, sorted in ascending order and excluding duplicates

ascension = users["Jonathan"][:favourite_numbers]
puts ascension.sort.uniq


8. Add the number `7` to Erik's favorite numbers

new_number = [7]
users ["Erik"][:favourite_numbers].push(new_number)
puts users["Erik"][:favourite_numbers]


9. Change Erik's hometown to Edinburgh

users ["Erik"][:home_town] = "Edinburgh"
puts users["Erik"][:home_town]


10. Add a pet dog to Erik called "Fluffy"

new_pet = { "fluffy" => :dog }
users ["Erik"][:pets].merge!(new_pet)
puts users["Erik"][:pets]


11. Add yourself to the users hash

new_user = {
  "Euan" => {
    :twitter => "no thanks",
    :favourite_numbers => [-123128319027418247913, -2353472589329-23534578342],
    :home_town => "Aberdeen pal",
    :pets => {
      "spud" => :cat,
      "murphy" => :cat
    }
  },
}

users.merge!(new_user)
puts users
